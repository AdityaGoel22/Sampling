# Sampling Techniques for ML Models with Dataset Balancing

## Overview

This notebook implements various sampling techniques on different machine learning models after balancing an imbalanced dataset.
The notebook includes the following steps:

  1. Loading the dataset
  2. Balancing the dataset
  3. Creating functions for machine learning models
  4. Creating five different samples using different sampling techniques
  5. Training and applying models' functions
  6. Evaluating the models' accuracy on each sample

The following sampling techniques are used:

  1. Simple Sampling
  2. Systematic Sampling
  3. Stratified Sampling
  4. Cluster Sampling
  5. Bootstrap Sampling

The following Machine Learning models are used:

  1. Logistic Regression
  2. Decision Tree
  3. Random Forest
  4. SVC
  5. Gradient Boosting
